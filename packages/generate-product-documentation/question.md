* What is an mdx file? An .mdx file is a Markdown file that allows you to include JSX (JavaScript XML) components within the Markdown content. MDX stands for Markdown with JSX. It is commonly used in projects that involve React, as it enables you to write Markdown and embed React components in the same file. This is particularly useful for documentation, blogs, and other content-driven applications where you want to mix static content with dynamic, interactive components.
