# Writing Guidance for Microsoft Products, Services, and Tools

## General Principles
When writing about Microsoft products, services, and tools, it’s essential to maintain clarity, consistency, and professionalism. Follow these core principles:

1. **Clarity**: Write with simplicity and precision. Avoid jargon and ambiguous terms.
2. **Consistency**: Use standard terms and formatting across all references.
3. **Inclusivity**: Use language that is respectful and accessible to all audiences.
4. **Brevity**: Be concise. Aim to communicate the message in as few words as necessary without sacrificing meaning.

## Style and Tone

### Tone
- Maintain a professional yet approachable tone.
- Be confident and positive but avoid unnecessary hyperbole.
- Avoid technical overcomplications; prioritize user understanding.

### Voice
- Use an active voice whenever possible. For example, "Save the file" instead of "The file can be saved."
- Use second-person perspective to engage users directly (e.g., "You can access your files in OneDrive").

## Branding Guidelines

### Product Names
- Always use official and full product names on the first mention (e.g., "Microsoft Teams").
- Subsequent mentions may use shorter versions if contextually clear (e.g., "Teams").
- Avoid abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely recognized (e.g., "AI" for artificial intelligence).

### Trademark Symbols
- Use trademark symbols (™, ®) where legally required on the first mention of a product name. For example, "Microsoft Windows®."
- Do not use trademark symbols in headings or subsequent mentions.

### Capitalization
- Capitalize the official names of products and services, such as "Microsoft Word," "Azure," and "PowerPoint."
- Use sentence case for commands and UI elements unless otherwise specified (e.g., "Click File > Open").

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headings
- Use descriptive headings to organize content logically.
- Employ Markdown syntax for headings:
  - `#` for main headings
  - `##` for subheadings
  - `###` for subsections

### Lists
- Use bullet points for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
- Ensure parallel structure in list items.

### Links
- Embed hyperlinks meaningfully. For example, "Learn more about [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)."
- Avoid phrases like "Click here" or "Read more."

### Code and Commands
- Use backticks for inline code or commands. Example: "Type `ipconfig` in the command prompt."
- For larger code blocks, use triple backticks with the language identifier:

```bash
az login
```

### UI Elements
- Use bold for UI elements (e.g., "Click **File** > **Save As**").
- Use quotation marks for button names if necessary (e.g., "Click the "Submit" button").

## Inclusive Language
- Avoid gendered language unless relevant (e.g., "they" instead of "he/she").
- Be mindful of cultural references and avoid idiomatic expressions.
- Ensure accessibility by avoiding overly complex terms or acronyms without explanations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Writing About Features
**Do**:
> With Microsoft Teams, you can host video calls, share files, and collaborate in real time.

**Don't**:
> Microsoft Teams is the ultimate collaboration tool with an array of cutting-edge features.

### Example 2: Instructions
**Do**:
> To create a new document in Word:
> 1. Open Microsoft Word.
> 2. Click **File** > **New**.
> 3. Select a template or choose **Blank Document**.

**Don't**:
> You should go to File, then New, and then select a template or start a blank document.
